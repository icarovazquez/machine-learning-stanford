Hi All! 

The girls have one match this week- they play Castilleja on Tuesday May 7th. 

Joe McDonald sent out a slight change in the schedule. So I want to confirm that the bus will leave Menlo at 2:30pm, the match is scheduled now for 3:40pm, and the girls should return to school by 5pm. 

Come out to cheer for this fabulous team! Go Knights! Kristin
